--------------------- CALCULATION ---------------------

Now calculating the reduced partition function ratio...
Primed variables (v', Q') refer to the light isotope.
ln(v/v'):  -0.08662239207232558
lnQ:  -11.91721477838377
lnQ':  -12.181192887280375
1000*lnB:  177.3557168242803

-------------- CONTRIBUTIONS TO FREQUENCY --------------

This section calculates the extent to which the isotope moves for each frequency.
The atomic number is extracted from isotope_contribution/atomic_number.csv. If the element you need is not present, please add it.
The absolute sum of the X,Y,Z coordinates is calculated for each frequency and stored in an array.
The atomic number of C is 6
Frequency contributions ascertained.
Number of frequencies that have light isotope movement: 3.
Number of frequencies that have heavy isotope movement: 3.

The number of light / heavy frequencies that contain isotope movement are the same.
Calculating RPFR with selected frequencies - treat this result with caution.
Now calculating the reduced partition function ratio...
