--------------- WRITING TO OUTPUT FILE ----------------

Creating file + associated directories.
The output filepath is: tests/log_files/water/frequency/outputs/H2O_both_freq.txt
Writing all extracted information to tests/log_files/water/frequency/outputs/H2O_both_freq.txt
Writing data to file...
