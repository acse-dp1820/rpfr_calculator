H2O_normal.txt and H2O_normal_cmd.txt show the outputs for log files with no isotopic information in log files, with the default isotope of oxygen being 16. In this case, both molecules were identical, so the reduced partition function is 0. 

H2O_light.txt and H2O_light_cmd.txt specify the light isotope of oxygen (16), and thus the program also returns a RPFR of 0.

H2O_heavy.txt and H2O_heavy_cmd.txt specify the heavy isotope of oxygen (18).

H2O_both.txt and H2O_both_cmd.txt are exemplary outputs.
