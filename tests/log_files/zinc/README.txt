The files in this folder were obtained from Prof Dominik Weiss' research group.

N.B. - ZNCL2_W_64.LOG and ZNCL2_W_66.LOG are both log files that do not have any optimisation / frequency analysis information. If the program is run with them as input variables, no extraction will occur and no data will be written to the output file.
