This folder contains an excel spreadsheet used to show the manual calculations to obtain the reduced partition function ratio (RPFR) for H2O, CO2, ZnSO4, ZnH2O, ZnCl4, ZnOXa and ZnDMA molecules.

The `zinc/` folder contains files used for `tests.py`.

The `water/` folder contains log files of simulations I ran to test functionality of `script.py`.

The log files in `linear/` use CO2 with 12-C and 13-C to confirm the functionality of the linear check.
